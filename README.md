# Data Manipulation and Visualization with PySpark in Microsoft Fabric

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing my hands-on experience with PySpark for data manipulation and visualization, as part of my learning journey on the Microsoft Learn platform. During this learning process, I explored the integration of Apache Spark with Microsoft Fabric, focusing on distributed data processing and insightful analytics.

Additionally, Iâ€™ve included a certificate of completion (PDF) to highlight my achievement in the module.

## Whatâ€™s Inside
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Demonstrates practical examples of data manipulation and visualization using PySpark. Key operations include:
- Reading data with Spark DataFrames
- Transforming data with Spark SQL
- Visualizing insights with PySpark and external libraries
- Completion Certificate: A PDF documenting the completion of the "Use Apache Spark in Microsoft Fabric" module.
